The benefits of a balanced and nutritious meal go many layers down to affect our body, mental health, and mood. And Sattvic foods are best-known to do this.

###### Is All Vegan and Vegetarian Food Halal? The short answer is not always. Despite what you may think, vegan and vegetarian food is not necessarily halal. Therefore, muslin vaganner sometimes find it difficult to find suitable food.
